# focuswatch.nvim

very simple nvim plugin to allow you to track time spent in a session in your editor.

## usage
`:Focuswatch timer_start` will open an input that allows you to specify how much time to start a timer for
`:Focuswatch timer_stop` will stop the current running timer

`:Focuswatch sw_start` will start a stopwatch
`:Focuswatch sw_stop` will stop the stopwatch

## TODO
* Better UI for countdown
